# Know-It-All

This is a React Native app created to be presented as the project for the React Native module of the Udacity's React Native Nanodegree course. Below you'll find a simple step-by-step of how to run this app on your computer:

1) Download this repository;
2) Open a command prompt;
3) Inside the command prompt, navigate to the project's directory;
4) Run the `yarn install` command and leave the prompt window open;
5) Install on you mobile phone the Expo app, for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779);
6) Create a Expo account either by accessing their [webpage](https://expo.io) or through their app, which you installed in the previous step;
7) Go back to the command prompt window and run `yarn start`;
8) An Expo menu will appear and you will be able to send a link to your phone so that you can open the app using the Expo app previously installed;
9) Once you open the link in your phone, the Know-It-All app will open and there you go!


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
